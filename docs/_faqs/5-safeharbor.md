Most of the existing anti-hacking laws pre-date the notion of hacking for good or widespread knowledge of the "digital locksmiths" who are increasingly influencing modern-day digital safety.    

These anti-hacking laws have been **used by organizations to suppress good-faith security research** in the pursuit of limiting negative publicity for the vendor, which nets out to a "chilling effect" on the input from the people the Internet needs to hear from most. **If hackers are the Internet's Immune System, then right now, even in 2021, the Internet still has an auto-immune problem.**   

"Safe Harbor" is the term used to describe clauses added to public policies which allow folks acting in good faith, as defined clearly and proactively by the recipient, to **provide security feedback without fear of legal repercussions.**  

disclose.io intends to help define, spread, and reward the adoption of vulnerability disclosure programs with best practices like Safe Harbor.
